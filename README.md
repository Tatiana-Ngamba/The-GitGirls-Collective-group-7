# GLOBAL IT SALARY ANALYSIS


## GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROJECT 
-‚óè Brief project
We have concluded the following aims that we want to achieve: 

To discover how salaries for IT jobs differ globally.
To explore the gender wage gap in relation to these IT salaries, across the world.
To explore the relationship between population density and salary values through a simple linear regression model.

To carry out this project we have used python, SQL, machine learning

This readme file outlines the instructions of how to run the project code



# üîß Prerequisites üîß
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
For the correct functioning of the project, before running any of the project code files, **the user must need to have installed in their PC My SQL Workbench, Python and Jupyter**. 

## Required Python Libraries and version compatibility:
Also make sure the following python libraries are installed. See the versions used for each of this libraries that allowed us to code and run this code effectively:

**Library == version**

‚óè pandas == 2.1.4

‚óè numpy == 1.26.2

‚óè seaborn == 0.13.0

‚óè matplotlib == 3.8.2

‚óè SQLAlchemy == 2.0.23

‚óè mysql-connector-python == 8.2.0

‚óè scikit-learn == 1.3.1

‚óè statsmodel == 0.14.0

‚óè geopandas == 0.14.0

Run the code <!pip install library_name> in your terminal to install each of the above modules:

!pip install pandas

!pip install numpy

!pip install seaborn

!pip install matplotlib

!pip install SQLAlchemy

!pip install mysql-connector-python

!pip install statsmodels

!pip install scikit-learn

!pip install sqlalchemy

!pip install geopandas



# üìÇ Data files and datasets üìÇ

## Jupyter Notebooks and Python files
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
 - Download both notebooks *GLOBAL IT SALARY ANALYSIS - Notebook Part 1 (Python API code)* and *GLOBAL IT SALARY ANALYSIS - Notebook Part 2 (Data Analysis)* from the branch Project Code [here](https://github.com/Tatiana-Ngamba/The-GitGirls-Collective-group-7/tree/Project_Code)
 - Download the python file *config.py* from [here]()
 - Select Python3 kernel for Jupyter notebook initialisation
 - Use the command - jupyter lab - in the python terminal to initialise it
 - Place both Jupyter Notebooks and the python file in the same path as the jupyter session just initialised


## Datasets 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Part of the data gets retrieved via an API call but this project makes use of additional data sources as csv and SQL files too.
In the same path where the Notebooks have been previously saved, create a folder named *Data* and download and place there the following datasets and files which can be downloaded from [here](): 
- excel 
- list all of our data files here 



# ‚ú® Ready to run ‚ú®

Once all the above steps have been followed, before running the notebooks, make sure to:

- Write your password to MySQL Workbench in the config.py file as follows: DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'Insert_password'
- Open MySQLWorkbench and run the SQL file
- Run JupyterNotebook Part 1 to retrieve the data from the API
- Run Jupyter Notebook Part 2 where all the used data merges together and all the visualizations are displayed
